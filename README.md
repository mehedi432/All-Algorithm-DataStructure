# Algorithm && Data Structures:
> The universe of algorithm and data structures

**This** is my personal offline collection of every algorithm and data structure one will ever encounter and use in a lifetime. This provides solutions in various languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go` and others.

# Algorithm && Data-Structures List:

Following is the high-level structure of cosmos:
* Artificial intelligence
* Backtracking
* Bit manipulation
* Cellular automaton
* Computational geometry
* Cryptography
* Data structures
* Divide conquering
* Dynamic programming
* Graph algorithms
* Greedy algorithms
* Mathematical algorithms
* Operating system
* Randomized algorithms
* Searching
* Selecting
* Sorting
* Square root decomposition
* String algorithms
* Unclassified 👻

Each type has several hundreds of problems with solutions in several languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go` and others.

# Maintainers

This is a massive collaboration and to keep the quality intact and drive the vision in the proper direction, we have maintainers.

> Maintainers are your friends forever. They are vastly different from moderators.
